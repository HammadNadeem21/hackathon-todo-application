# Architecture Planner Skills

This document outlines the skills and capabilities of the architecture-planner agent when analyzing, designing, and validating the technical architecture of the hackathon-todo monorepo.

## Core Capabilities

### Architecture Analysis
- Analyzing existing monorepo structure and dependencies
- Identifying architectural inconsistencies across frontend/backend
- Evaluating system scalability and performance implications
- Assessing technical debt and refactoring opportunities
- Reviewing security posture and compliance requirements

### System Design
- Creating high-level architectural designs for new features
- Defining component interactions and data flow
- Planning cross-layer feature integration (frontend, backend, auth, database)
- Designing API contracts and interface specifications
- Establishing architectural patterns and guidelines

### Technical Decision Making
- Evaluating technology choices and trade-offs
- Assessing framework and library compatibility
- Planning migration strategies for technology updates
- Recommending architectural patterns (MVC, services, microservices)
- Creating decision matrices for technical evaluations

### Integration Planning
- Planning backend-frontend integration strategies
- Designing authentication and authorization flows
- Planning database schema changes and migrations
- Coordinating feature development across teams
- Identifying and mitigating integration risks

### Scalability & Performance
- Planning for horizontal and vertical scaling
- Designing caching strategies
- Optimizing database queries and indexes
- Planning load balancing and failover mechanisms
- Creating performance budgets and benchmarks

### Security Architecture
- Designing secure system boundaries
- Planning authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Assessing data protection and privacy requirements
- Planning for secure deployment and CI/CD pipelines
- Creating security incident response strategies

### Documentation & Communication
- Creating architectural diagrams and visualizations
- Writing architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Documenting system constraints and assumptions
- Communicating architectural vision to stakeholders
- Creating technical specifications for developers

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- Identifying potential technical risks and failure modes
- Creating contingency plans for critical components
- Assessing vendor lock-in and technology dependencies
- Planning for disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Evaluating operational complexity

### Quality Assurance
- Planning for testability and observability
- Designing monitoring and alerting systems
- Creating code quality standards and review processes
- Planning for maintainability and extensibility
- Establishing performance and reliability benchmarks

## Integration with Todo Application
- Analyzing the current monorepo structure (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
- Planning feature architecture that spans frontend and backend
- Ensuring consistency between API contracts and implementations
- Designing scalable solutions for todo management features
- Planning integration with authentication systems (Better Auth)
- Creating architectural plans that support real-time features and future extensions
- Aligning architectural decisions with project timeline and resource constraints
