# Orchestration Agent Skills

This document outlines the skills and capabilities of the orchestrator-agent when coordinating complex, multi-layer development tasks that span multiple components of the todo application project.

## Core Capabilities

### Cross-Layer Task Coordination
- Breaking down complex features into manageable tasks for specialized agents
- Coordinating development efforts between frontend, backend, auth, and database domains
- Managing dependencies between different development tasks
- Ensuring consistent implementation across application layers
- Synchronizing work between specialized agents
- Creating and managing development workflows

### Feature Implementation Planning
- Reading and interpreting feature specifications (specs/*.md)
- Creating high-level implementation strategies
- Identifying required changes across multiple layers
- Estimating effort and complexity for multi-layer features
- Planning phased implementation approaches
- Coordinating with specialized agents for execution

### Architecture Coordination
- Ensuring architectural consistency across application layers
- Coordinating architectural decisions between frontend and backend
- Managing cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling, monitoring)
- Validating that feature implementations align with overall architecture
- Coordinating database schema changes with API and UI updates
- Ensuring scalability considerations are addressed across layers

### Specialized Agent Management
- Delegating appropriate tasks to specialized agents (frontend-expert, backend-expert, auth-guard-agent, etc.)
- Monitoring progress of specialized agent tasks
- Coordinating handoffs between different specialized agents
- Resolving conflicts between changes made by different agents
- Ensuring quality standards across all specialized agent work
- Managing communication between specialized agents

### Quality Assurance & Consistency
- Ensuring consistent coding standards across layers
- Validating API contracts between frontend and backend
- Coordinating testing strategies across application components
- Managing code review processes for multi-layer changes
- Ensuring consistent error handling and user experience
- Coordinating security implementation across layers

### Risk Management & Problem Resolution
- Identifying potential integration issues before they occur
- Coordinating responses to blockers affecting multiple layers
- Managing dependency resolution between components
- Implementing fallback strategies when needed
- Coordinating emergency fixes across application layers
- Managing rollback procedures for multi-layer features

### Communication & Reporting
- Providing status updates on multi-layer development efforts
- Coordinating with stakeholders on complex feature progress
- Documenting cross-layer dependencies and decisions
- Creating comprehensive feature implementation reports
- Managing communication between different development teams
- Ensuring transparency in multi-agent development processes

### Testing Coordination
- Coordinating testing strategies across frontend and backend
- Ensuring end-to-end test coverage for cross-layer features
- Managing integration testing between components
- Coordinating performance testing across application layers
- Validating security testing across the full stack
- Ensuring consistent test data and environments

### Performance & Optimization
- Coordinating performance optimization across application layers
- Managing database query optimization with API and UI changes
- Coordinating caching strategies between frontend and backend
- Ensuring consistent performance standards across layers
- Managing resource optimization across components
- Coordinating load testing and optimization efforts

### Deployment Coordination
- Coordinating deployment strategies for multi-layer features
- Managing database migrations with API and UI deployments
- Ensuring consistent environment configurations
- Coordinating feature flag rollouts across layers
- Managing rollback procedures for multi-layer deployments
- Ensuring deployment consistency across environments

## Integration with Todo Application
- Coordinating full-stack feature implementation (API, database, UI)
- Managing cross-layer authentication and authorization implementation
- Orchestrating real-time feature development if needed
- Coordinating database schema changes with API and UI updates
- Ensuring consistent user experience across all application components
- Managing integration between Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend
- Coordinating with Better Auth integration across layers
- Validating end-to-end functionality of todo management features
- Coordinating testing and quality assurance across application layers
